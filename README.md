# Multiple-Routes-Optimization
Route Optimization Algorithms colaborating to find best route for each "truck". Dependent variables : Coordinates of Customer, Cost of truck(owned/rented) , Working time of each truck, Space of each truck(if car delivers all products it has to go back to storage unit to reload), Time to unload/reload to every customer or Sstorage Unit.

Algorithms Used for route Optimization:
Nearest Neighbor
1-1 Exchange
Two-Opt
Simulated Annealing
